# Anatomy Stressors Q-Sort (HTMLQ Implementation)

This repository contains the full HTMLQ-based Q-sort application developed by **Oheneba Boadum (2025)** for the study:

**"Perceptions of Anatomy-Related Stressors Among First-Year DO Students"**

The tool enables participants to sort **44 anatomy-related stressor statements** into a forced distribution from **–4 (least characteristic)** to **+4 (most characteristic)**.  
It integrates seamlessly with **Qualtrics** for participant identification (PID), demographic linkage, and return flow after sorting.

## ⚙️ Features
- Fully browser-based Q-sort (no installation required)
- Customizable `statements.csv` for your own research topics
- Redirects to Qualtrics for pre/post-survey items
- Mobile-responsive interface
- Hosted easily via **GitHub Pages**

## 🔁 Reuse and Adaptation

Researchers may adapt the *technical framework* (HTMLQ structure and Qualtrics integration) for their own Q-sort projects by replacing the study-specific statements with their own.

Please retain the citation below if you use or modify this framework.  
The specific anatomy-related statements and survey text remain the intellectual property of the original author.

## 🧠 About the Study

This project was developed as part of an investigation into **anatomy-related stressors among first-year osteopathic medical students**, employing **Q-methodology** to explore subjective perceptions of learning stressors reported by Boadum et al. (2024).

The web app was built using **HTMLQ**, customized for integration with institutional Qualtrics survey flow, and deployed via GitHub Pages.
