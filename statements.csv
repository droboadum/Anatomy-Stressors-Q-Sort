1,Limited faculty or TA supervision in lab increased my stress.
2,I felt performance pressure when faculty closely supervised dissections.
3,Inadequate supervision across lab sessions added to my stress.
4,Personality or working-style differences within my dissection group often made collaboration stressful.
5,Working in a dissection group felt more stressful than studying or dissecting on my own.
6,Unequal effort among group members made me feel overburdened during dissection.
7,I often felt pressured to take on extra tasks because others in my group were less engaged.
8,I felt emotionally unprepared for the first donor lab experience.
9,Anatomy triggered emotional responses I did not expect.
10,The emotional impact of lab faded only after several weeks.
11,Encountering death in the lab setting was a significant source of anxiety for me.
12,The donor’s identity or humanity sometimes made dissection emotionally difficult.
13,"The donor’s physical condition (e.g., adiposity or tissue quality) made dissection more difficult."
14,Excess subcutaneous tissue (adipose/fat) made dissection more technically challenging.
15,Donor tissue that was hard to distinguish made anatomy harder to learn.
16,Poor dissection quality at my table made it harder to learn and increased my stress.
17,I was anxious about performing poor-quality dissections.
18,Seeing poor dissection in my group heightened my stress.
19,Having no prior anatomy experience made the course more stressful.
20,I felt anatomy was taught in a way that favored students with prior experience.
21,I sometimes felt less confident than peers who had taken anatomy before.
22,The amount of new anatomical terminology was overwhelming.
23,I worried about remembering anatomical terminology long-term.
24,Learning terminology helped me better understand clinical concepts.
25,The course presented too much information at once.
26,The pace of the course was too fast to consolidate learning.
27,Anatomy emphasized memorization over conceptual understanding.
28,Inconsistent teaching styles across faculty increased my stress.
29,Adapting to different anatomy teaching approaches was difficult.
30,I learned best when faculty used clinically integrated teaching methods.
31,Fear of failing assessments was my main stressor.
32,"High-stakes exams (midterm, end of term, NBME/COMLEX-style) were a major source of anxiety."
33,I worried that anatomy performance would affect my residency competitiveness.
34,I struggled to plan and monitor my own learning in this course.
35,I was unsure how to study effectively for anatomy exams.
36,"Self-directed learning in anatomy (relying on the atlas and lab manual to identify structures and complete dissections by myself) was a source of stress and sometimes left me feeling isolated."
37,Time in anatomy lab was insufficient to learn what was tested.
38,Anatomy stress mostly came from time constraints.
39,"Course scheduling (e.g., back-to-back lectures/labs, booking review sessions, etc.) added to my stress."
40,Anatomy’s clinical relevance helped reduce my stress.
41,Knowing anatomy is essential for Step/COMLEX makes me more stressed.
42,"Near-peer tutoring (from classmates, or 2nd years) reduced my anatomy stress."
43,Strong peer support helped me manage anatomy stress.
44,"Overall, I was able to cope effectively with the stressors in anatomy."
